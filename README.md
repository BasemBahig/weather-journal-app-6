## Introduction
I studied and prepared for this project two weeks continuosly almost 5 hours or more per day, this project is new for me, my daily normal work involved in counsultancy for HRIS application via UI not the backend.
I joined this track to learn how to use API and be profesionall in this subject.
That because I intend to move forwared in career shift to be programmer.
accordingly I studied hardly and checked many Youtubes vidoe as provided also I checked Udacity old webinars which really supported me to get an appropriate knowldge to complete the project.
# I would like to thank fwd community for their support and help to reach this level

I would like to emphasize on the way I followd to complete this project:
1- I start to study Udacity class leesons but frankly it was hard somehow in the begining to get all reuiqred info, then I started my practices process via many other resources in order to accomplish that sucessully,
2- I checked the following YouTubes vidoes to be aware and apply prctically my projecct

4- I return back to my class in udacity then I found the leesons clear enough not like as the first time.
5- I applied the server installation and configured the server.js many times via many trails.
6- in app.js I really stucked but I kept learning and fwd comunity was very supportive to guide me.
